Update #1:

The GUI interface needs to be done in C++.

This will be preferably done with QT 4 Creator so as 
to make it easier on the designer and implementation.

First time power up screen will show the list of available networks 
and allow for user to select that network to proceed and have possible
input for password entry.

Second Screen on default power up will be to display a QR code
that the contains the ip address of the cooker so that the user 
can just scan it with their phone to make the connection.  It 
will also display the information embedded in the qr code so that 
if the users phone is not able to read the lcd screen. They can input 
the information manually.  

Third Screen will be just display information on the cooker and possible 
updates from our git server and wait for user input from the phone. 
It will also display confirmation messages so that the user can verify 
what was sent from the phone.

Fourth Screen will just display information from the cooker and the 
status of the cooking meal.  This will be stuff set later once we have
set up the system and can read the information.
